The space of mappings in the software synthesis flow we described has a rich mathematical structure. This chapter aims to explore and expose that structure, at least in part. We will consider two main aspects of the mathematical structure hidden within the simple notion of a mapping, namely the inherent symmetry, and the degrees of similarity between mappings. We will consider how to extract this structure in a computationally-efficient fashion, and how in can be exposed to tools that aim to exploit it, in different representations.
