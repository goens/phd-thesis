\subsection{Partial Symmetries}

The symmetries we have considered so far can be considered as ``global'' symmetries: they are transformations of the complete structure (e.g. architecture, mapping).
The intuitive notion of symmetry, however, is more general than this. What we consider as symmetry also inlcludes the relationship of as tructure to each parts.
In particular, a symmetry can be local to a part of the structure, without being global. A general discussion of this can be found in~\cite{lawson_inverse_semigroups}, as well as a detailed exposition of the mathematical background of this section.

We can see what we mean by local structures in the example depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:motivation_partial_symmetries}.
It shows two \ac{NoC} architectures both with a regular mesh topology.
The first one is a two-by-two mesh, the second one four-by-four.
We can compare now the symmetries of both architectures intuitively, and see how these translate to the group-theoretic sense.
The four-by-four mesh is larger, and has a sort of self-similarity: it can be thought of as composed of four copies of the two-by-two mesh arranged in a larger two-by-two mesh.
Intuitively, thus, this four-by-four mesh has more symmetry.

\end{figure}

However, if we look at the group of automorphisms of the corresponding architecture graphs, we get a result that defies this intuition:
both archtiectures have the same groups of symmetries!
More precisely, their groups of automorphisms are isomorphic, they are dihederal groups on 4 points, $D_4$.
More concretely, there are only 8  possible structure-preserving transformations acting on these two topologies, which are the rotations of $90^\circ,180^\circ,270^\circ,360^\circ = 0^\circ$ and the reflections among each of the axes (horizontal, vertical and both diagonals). We cannot, for example, divide the four-by-four mesh into a two-by-two mesh of two-by-two meshes, and rotate that larger two-by-two mesh by $90^\circ$ or one of the smaller ones by $90^\circ$. These two operations both work locally, if we ignore the rest of the structure, but do not preserve the whole structure of the mesh, as illustrated by Figure~\ref{fig:partial_symmetries_4x4}.

There are essentially two ways equvialent ways of formalizing this intuitive notion of local symmetries, inverse semigroups and ordered groupoids~\cite{lawson_inverse_semigroups}.
We will consider the formalization using inverse semigroups, as it is conceptually simpler for computations, and mathematically equally as powerful.
In the case of global symmetries there are concrete trasformations of architectures and mappings and corrpesponding abstract groups. For partial symmetries we will consider partial trasformations of mappings which we will model as partial permutations, and these partial permutations (transformations) have a corresponding abstract inverse semigroup.

We start by defining partial functions and partial permutations.
\begin{defn}
Let X,Y be sets.
A \emph{partial function} $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a function from a subset of $X$ to a subset of $Y$.
We denote the domain of by $\dom(f)$ the codomain of $f$ by $\cod(f)$.
Thus, the partial function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a (total) function $f: \dom(f) \rightarrow \cod(f)$
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
Let $X$ be a set.
A partial function $f: X \rightarrow X$ from $X$ to itself is called a \emph{partial permutation} if the (total) function $f: \dom(f) \rightarrow \cod(f)$ is a bijection between $\dom(f)$ and $\cod(f)$.
\end{defn}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
   \resizebox{0.55\textwidth}{!}{\input{figures/placeholder.tex}}
	\caption{An example of a partial permutation in a $4 \times 4$ mesh.}
	\label{fig:example_partial_permutation}
\end{figure}

We can think of partial functions thus as functions that are not defined everywhere, and partial permutations, acordingly, are not defined everywhere.
For example, the partial permutation $f : \{0,\ldots,15\} \rightarrow \{0,\ldots,15\}$ defined as $f(0) = 4, f(1) = 0, f(4) = 5, f(5) = 1$ is a rotation of the upper-left $2 \times 2$-mesh in the $4\times 4$-mesh, but is not defined on the rest of the architecure. This is a partial symmetry of the $4\times 4$-mesh. This partial permutation is dpeicted in Figure~\ref{fig:example_partial_permutation}. We can write it also as:
\begin{equation*}
\left(
\begin{array}{llllllllllllllll}
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15\\
4 & 0 & - & - & 5 & 1 & - & - & - & - &  - &  - &  - &  - &  - &  -
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation*}
Because the set $\{0,\ldots,15\}$ is understood from context, we can also write it, shorter, as:
\begin{equation*}
\left(
\begin{array}{llll}
0 & 1 & 4 & 5 \\
4 & 0 &  5 & 1
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation*}

We also use a notation similar to the cycle notation of group theory, where we use a cicle with round brackets to denote a full cycle, where the last element maps to the first.
Square brackets to denote when this is not the case, i.e. the function is not defined on the last element of that cycle. In this notation, singleton cycles cannot be omitted as in the case of groups.
In other words, fixed points have to be represented as one-element cycles.
The partial permutation from Figure~\ref{fig:example_partial_permutation} can thus be written much more compactly as: $(0,4,5,1)$.
This is a full cycle, but it is only defined on the subset $\{0,1,4,5\}$.
In the group context, the cycle $(0,4,5,1)$ as an element of the symmetric group on 15 points, would instead mean the (complete) permutation that fixes $\{2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15\}$.
As a partial permutation in cycle notation we would write this as: \[(0,4,5,1)(2)(3)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15) \]
A different example of a partial permutation is the partial permutation that moves the first row to the right (and is not defined on the rest), as a cycle: $[0,1][4,5][8,9][12,13]$.
On the other hand, the partial permutation that is a diagonal reflection on the upper-left $2 \times 2$ (sub)mesh is, in cycle notation, $(1,4)(0)(5)$.
These two partial permutations can also be written in the matrix notation from above as:

\begin{equation*}
\left(
\begin{array}{llll}
0 & 4 & 8 & 12 \\
1 & 5 & 9 & 13 
\end{array}
\right)
\quad
\left(
\begin{array}{llll}
0 & 1 & 4 & 5 \\
0 & 4 & 1 & 5
\end{array}
\right)
\end{equation*}

For computations~\cite{standrews}, the three notations can be interpreted to make different data structures that make different opperations more efficient, like application of the partial function (as an array look-up), for sparse partial permutations (as lookups in key-value pairs), or cycles for efficient multiplication (as concatenation). They have different benefits and drawbacks. For readability though, the cycle notation is the most compact one, and the one we will use for the rest of this thesis.

Just as for groups, we can define the (left) action of a semigroup:
\begin{defn}
Let $S$ be a semigroup and $X$ be a set. We say that $S$ \emph{acts} on $X$ (on the left) if there is a function $\cdot : S \times X \rightarrow X$ such that $(ab) \cdot x = a \cdot (b \cdot x)$. If $S$ is a monoid with identity $1$ and the function $\cdot$ satisfies the condition $1 \cdot x = x$ for all $x \in X$, we say that the action is a monoid action.
\end{defn}

The action of a semigroup of partial permutations to an architecture works the same as with groups, except it does not work on the whole architecture.
Let $f$ be a partial permutation on an architecture $A$, and $m : T \rightarrow A$ be a mapping on that arcticeture.
If the partial permutation is defined on all cores mappend on by $m$, i.e., $im(m) \subseteq \dom(f)$, then we can use the action of the semigroup of partial permutations of $A$ to define another mapping $fm$ by $fm(t) = f \cdot m(t)$
for all $t$ in $T$. If $f$ is not defined on some of the cores of $m$, i.e., $im(m) \not \subseteq \dom(f)$, then we cannot define $fm$. In this way, $f$ also defines a partial permutation $\hat f$ on the set of mappings $\{ m : T \rightarrow A \}$.
\todo{check that notation is consistent}

Consider for example the mapping of an application with three tasks to the $4 \times 4$-mesh defined by $m_0(t_0) = m_0(t_2) = \PE_0$ and $m_0(t_1) = \PE_1$, which we can also write as the vector $m_0 = (0,1,0)$.
Then the partial permutation $(0,4,5,1)$ from Figure~\ref{fig:exapmle_partial_permutation} above defines the mapping $(0,4,5,1)m = (4,0,4)$.
Similarly, the action of the partial permutation $(1,4)(0)(5)$ yields a new mapping, $(1,4)(0)(5)m_0 = (0,4,0)$.
However, since the translation $[0,1][4,5][8,9][12,13]$ is not defined on $1 = m_0(t_1)$, we cannot define $[0,1][4,5][8,9][12,13]$ as a mapping.
Formally we can say that the partial permutations $\widehat{(0,4,5,1)}$ and $\widehat{(1,4)(0)(5)}$ are defined on $m_0$, but $\widehat{[0,1][4,5][8,9][12,13]}$ is not defined on $m_0$.

We can interpret this in a different way, using graph isomorphisms.
Recall that a mapping $m: T \rightarrow A$ can be seen as a morphism of graphs from $T$ to $A$.
In particular, every mapping $m$ defines a subgraph $m(T) \leq A$.
We can

\todo{prove that this two ways of defining partial symmetries define the same}
\begin{thm}
Let $A$ be an architecture with inverse semigroup of automorphisms $S = \AutSemi(A)$, and let $m,m' : T \rigtharrow A$ be mappings. Then the subgraphs $m(T), m'(T) \leq A$ are isomorphic iff there exists a partial permutation $f \in S$, such that $m = fm'$.
\todo{this won't work if I don't include application symmetries too}
\end{thm}
