This section will survey some of the most important concurrent models of computation. Before diving into the models, we will first discuss the mathematical semantics\footnote{Nowadays we call these semantics denotational} of computation by Scott.

\subsection{Partial Computation: Scott Domains}

When Dana Scott proposed his mathematical theory of computation~\cite{scott1970}, he used the term mathematical to contrast it with operational computation.
In practice, the steps of a computation are defined by the \ac{ISA} of the machine executing them.
Most people don't write programs directly for the \ac{ISA}, however. They write them in an abstract programming language, which is translated by a compiler into machine instructions.
Thus, in practice, the implementation of a compiler is what defines the (operational) semantics of programs.
Scott's theory had the ambitious goal of being an abstraction that sat between these operational semantics and the abstract notions of computability of e.g. Church or Turing.
He intended to abstract away the arbitrary implementation choices that were necessary but did not change the essence of the execution.
While today his model is not the single established abstract model of semantics he sought out to define, it introduced several important ideas and mathematical structures to models of computation.
In particular, a crucial abstraction introduced by his theory is that of partial computation.
His theory makes it possible to express a computation as a series of partial results, without regarding the actual implementation of these.
We will now introduce the basics of Scott's mathematical theory of computation.


A Domain is a particular type of \ac{poset} ... 

For example ...


Scott's computation model implicitly assumed a sequential computation and Scott-continuous functions are a powerful method for describing partial sequential computations.
Can we also use this model to describe parallel computation?
Gilles Kahn did precisely this, four years after Scott published his mathematical theory of computation. 
He used the formalism of Scott to define a model of parallel computation, based on what he coined as process networks, now known as Kahn Process Networks.

The basic idea to generalize the Scott theory of computation is simple
