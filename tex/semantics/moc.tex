The formal concept of computation is at the center of computer science.
By the Church-Turing (hypo)thesis, the computational models of Lambda Calculus and Turing Machines represent anything that is computable in the physical world, and form the basis of computability.
These models are, however, best suited to describe what should be computed, not how.
A long tradition of research has delved deeper into the question of how to compute, spawning several different models of computation.
