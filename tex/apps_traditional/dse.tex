General DSE for this, heuristics/metaheuristics.

\subsection{Heuristics and Metaheuristics}

Discuss what metaheuristics are.
Here I should summarize~\cite{goens_mcsoc16}.

Discuss genetic, tabu search, simulated annealing for mapping.

\subsection{Leveraging Symmetries}
Talk about~\cite{goens_taco17} + new stuff (mpsym)

\subsection{Leveraging Metric Spaces}
Improving DSE algorithms with metric spaces?

Talk about gradient descent: why it does not work w/o metric space structure, and why it should with it.
