General DSE for this, heuristics/metaheuristics.

\subsection{Heuristics and Metaheuristics}

Discuss what metaheuristics are.
Here I should summarize~\cite{goens_mcsoc16}.

Discuss genetic, tabu search, simulated annealing for mapping.

Parameters: random walk $500$ random iterations, genetic $20$ generations of population size $10$, crossover rate of $1$ with probability $0.35$ and mutation probability $0.5$, with a tournament selection with tournament size $4$ and a $\mu + \lambda$ strategy.
\ac{GBM} with \texttt{bx\_m} of $1$, \texttt{bx\_p} of $0.95$, \texttt{by\_m} of $0.5$,\texttt{by\_p} of $0.75$, 
simulated annealing with an initial temperature of $1$ and a final temperature of $0.1$, with a temperature proportionality constant of $0.5$  and a random movement starting radius of $5$.
Tabu search with a maximum of $30$ iterations, each of size $5$ and with a move set size of $10$ and tabu tenure of $5$, and a random candidate move update radius of $2$.

\subsection{Leveraging Symmetries}
Talk about~\cite{goens_taco17} + new stuff (mpsym)

\subsection{Leveraging Metric Spaces}
Improving DSE algorithms with metric spaces?

Talk about gradient descent: why it does not work w/o metric space structure, and why it should with it.
