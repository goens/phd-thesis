So far the applications of the structures we have discussed are primarily useful at compile- or design-time.
In this section we will discus \acs{TETRiS}, a hybrid mapping approach where the structure of mapping symmetries are useful at runtime.

In Section~\ref{sec:symmetries} we saw how the symmetries of the mapping problem define multiple mappings to be equivalent.
We expect mappings that are equvialent to have the same runtime or energy cosumption. Indeed, the simulation results are identical for equivalent mappings.

When leveraging this structure for \ac{DSE}, we considered only one of the multiple equivalent mappings, disregarding the rest, since they 
The \acf{TETRiS} approach kk

Just focus on idea of using symmetries (+ flow) (~\cite{goens_scopes17}). Runtime system + measurements are for Robert/Till's dissertations.
Use simulations here (new).
