The nature of this thesis is not focused enough that we discuss related work from a general point of view.
Perhaps the closest in spirit to the work presented in this thesis is the Ptolemy project~\cite{Ptolemaeus:14:SystemDesign}.
It is a tool for exploring model-based design and has a strong focus on \acp{cps}.
The Ptolemy project is very comprehensive and studies and implements several \acp{MoC} discussed in this thesis (cf. Section~\ref{sec:mocs_overview}).
It is, however, aimed at application developers. In contrast, the methods in this thesis are aimed at tool developers, for improving the methods of model-based design.

Instead of discussing related work generally, we will go over on the different methods proposed here to improve model-based design, and discuss related work by broader categories.

In particular, we will separate work related to  to symmetries and mapping space representations. We will

include symmetries.
